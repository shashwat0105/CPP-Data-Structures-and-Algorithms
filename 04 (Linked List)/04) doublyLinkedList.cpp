In Doubly linked lists 

Each node contains two pointers, one pointing to the next node and the other pointing to the previous node.
The prev of Head node is NULL, as there is no previous node of Head.
The next of last node is NULL, as there is no node after the last node.

// C++ Implementation

struct Node{
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
    struct Node *prev;
};


// Advantage:
// In a singly linked list, to delete a node, a pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. 
// In DLL, we can get the previous node using the previous pointer.


// Disadvantage:
// Every node of DLL requires extra space for a previous pointer.
// All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, an insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers.

    }

    while(temp!=NULL){     // here coz temp is pointing to last node
        cout<<temp->data<<" ";

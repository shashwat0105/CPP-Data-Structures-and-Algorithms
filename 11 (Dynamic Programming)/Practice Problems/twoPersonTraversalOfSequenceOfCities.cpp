You are given an ordered sequence of n cities, and the distances between every pair of cities. 
You must partition the cities into two subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) such that person A visits all cities in the first subsequence (in order), 
person B visits all cities in the second subsequence (in order), and such that the sum of the total distances travelled by A and B is minimized. 
Assume that person A and person B start initially at the first city in their respective subsequences.

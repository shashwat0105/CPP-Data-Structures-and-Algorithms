// THEORY OF EDGES
// We perform a DFS and classify the encountered edges using the following rules:

// If v is not visited:

// Tree Edge - If v is visited after uu then edge (u,v)(u,v) is called a tree edge. In other words, if v is visited for the first time and uu is currently being visited then (u,v)(u,v) is called tree edge. 
// These edges form a DFS tree and hence the name tree edges.

// If v is visited before uu:

// Back edges - If v is an ancestor of uu, then the edge (u,v)(u,v) is a back edge. vv is an ancestor exactly if we already entered v, but not exited it yet. 
// The back edges complete a cycle as there is a path from ancestor v to descendant uu (in the recursion of DFS) and an edge from descendant uu to ancestor v (back edge), thus a cycle is formed. Cycles can be detected using back edges.
// A back edge connects a node to its ancestor which is not its direct parent.
// Hene, a back edge can never be a bridge


// Forward Edges - If v is a descendant of uu, then edge (u,v)(u,v) is a forward edge. In other words, if we already visited and exited v and entry[u]<entry[v]entry[u]<entry[v] then the edge (u,v)(u,v) forms a forward edge.
// A Forward edge may or may not be a bridge.


// Cross Edges - if vv is neither an ancestor or descendant of uu, then edge (u,v)(u,v) is a cross edge. In other words, if we already visited and exited vv and entry[u]>entry[v]entry[u]>entry[v] then (u,v)(u,v) is a cross edge.

// thus carving out an alternate path from source to node.



// Explanation for: low[node] = min(low[node], low[child]);  // minimising the current node
// we update low time of 3 marking that there is a child of 3 by which we can reach 2 and which is node 4. 
// when we backtrack to node 2, he found that low time of 3 is equal to his in time. then 2 will understand there is a back edge of 3's child to reach him. 
// thus node 2 understand 2-3 is not a bridge.
// After checking a forward edge weather it is bridge or not , 
// low[node] = min(low[node], low[child]) , this condition would update the low[node] of the parent only if its child node's low will be smaller than that of parent node .
// It would be true only if child has a backedge to a node that is ancestor to both child and parent , so it is imp to update parent low to this value.
// It would also be true when decendent of child has a backedge to a node that is ancestor to both current node and its parent , as  because of recursion it would keep on updating ....

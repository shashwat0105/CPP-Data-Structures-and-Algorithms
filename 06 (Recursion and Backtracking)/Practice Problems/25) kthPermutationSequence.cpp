// Brute force to start in interview:
// Generate all permutations using recursion, store it in a data structure, sort it. 
// Kth permutation will lie at k-1 th index. Given we are using 0 based indexing.
// TC = O(N!*N*NlogN) ; N! for recursion, N for deep copy, NlogN for sorting.

// Don't jump to optimal solution directly

// Optimal:
// Similar to finding the position of a word in a dictionary done in 12th class

// {7, 8, 9, 10}
// Like permutations beginning with 1 are 6, with 2 are 6, we divide it recursively to obtain our result.
// Say k = 17 (16th in 0based indexing)
// 7 "8 9 10" ie 3! = 6 numbers that start with 7
// 8  : 6 numbers that start with 8
// 9  : 6 numbers that start with 9, 16 will lie here: 16%6 = 4th number in permutation of [7 8 10] again repeat the process.
// 10 : 6 numbers that start with 10


// TC - O(N^2)
// SC - O(N)

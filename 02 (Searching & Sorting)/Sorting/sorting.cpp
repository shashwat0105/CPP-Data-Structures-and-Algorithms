In-Place Sorting: An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only). It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list.
These are :-
1) Insertion Sort
2) Bubble Sort
3) Selection Sort
4) Heap Sort

4) Quick sort is also known as in Place sorting algo

Stable Sorting algo
A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys(value) appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.
1) Insertion Sort
2) Bubble Sort 
3) Merge Sort 
4) Count Sort etc.

Unstable:-
1) Heap Sort
2) Quick Sort

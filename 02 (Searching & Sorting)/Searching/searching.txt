C++ has inbuilt function sort()

Knapsack & Fractional Knapsack
In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack.

Hashing
In c++ inbuilt :- unordered map :- key & value 2 things
Number -> Index -> 0 or 1 , multiple values in same index goes in form of list at that index.
Time complexity is O(1) for inserting, deleting & searching. Worst case of searching can be O(k), k
is number of elements in the list.
Hashing searching is O(1)
Uses extra space O(n)
In Hashing we don't search by comparing to the value stored(linear/binary search) but by array index/key.
Index = Hash_Function(Key), In case key is not equal to the array index. So, we fetch the index by passing key in a Hash Function which does the
required calculation.
Hash function is used 2 times, 1st while inserting/deleting the data 2nd while searching the key.
Parameters of a good hash function:- 1) Easy to compute 2) Even Distribution 3) Minimise Collisions
We generally do modulo to shorten the size of keys into size of index(size of hash table)



Finding any repeating elements

Checking if 2 arrays are equal or not
M1 Sorting then comparing
M2 Using Hashing

In built functions in C++ STL 
These all three functions accepts the start iterator, end iterator and the element to be checked as parameters and returns 
binary_search()  True if the element is present otherwise False. Does not give any information about the location of the element if it exists.
upper_bound()   returns the iterator pointing to the element just > the element passed(whether the element is present or not). If all the element in the range compare less than val, the function returns last. 
lower_bound()   returns the iterator pointing to the element >= the element passed(whether the element is present or not).

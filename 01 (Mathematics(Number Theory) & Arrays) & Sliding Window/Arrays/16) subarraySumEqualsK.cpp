// subarray[L ... R] = pref[R] - pref[L-1]
// Explanation: we keep an accumulator variable sum with the running total of the sum of numbers; 
// we then check if we have already met that values using our seen hashmap that acts more or less like a frequency table, 
// storing how many times we have encountered a specific value: sum - k.
// That is why if have met sum - k before and now the value is sum, the difference between those specific points and the current iteration is, by definiton, exactly k: 
// we are now at sum, so, the interval between the previous point(s) and now sums up to, by definition, sum - (sum - k), which equates k.
// We collect all those occurrences in count and finally we return it.


// Target is another small prefix sum, which checks if Bigger prefix sum - k exists in the hashmap.
// pref - target is the sum of that subarray
